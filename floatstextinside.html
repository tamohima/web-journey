        The paragraphs that you write must follow a very specific structure. As mentioned
        before, you have to come up with the topic that you want to write about and then
        choose a topic sentence.For example, say you wanted to write a paragraph about dogs.
        The first thing you would do is write a topic sentence, such as, 
        “When it comes to animals, dogs are a great pet.” Now you have a topic, which is not
        just dogs, but talking about what makes dogs a great pet.
