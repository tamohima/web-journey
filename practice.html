    <h1>Alhamdulliah</h1>
    <p1>
        Happiness is a warm puppy.<br>
        Happiness shared is happiness doubled.<br>
        Learn to value yourself, which means: fight for your happiness.<br>
        If you want to be happy, be.<br>
    </p1>

    <p2>
        <br>Count your age by friends, not years.<br>
        Someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.<br>
        Nothing in the world is as contagious as laughter and good humor.<br>
