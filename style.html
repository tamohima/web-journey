        The video of this blatant extrajudicial killing was shared like wildfire online,
        igniting a fire that brought hundreds and thousands of students across the country
        into the streets.Educators, lawyers, parents and rickshaw pullers joined them in 
        solidarity,in anger and mourning over the death of Sayed and more than 200 other 
        protesters who died at the hands of government-aligned student activists and armed
        forces.
